    "\n",
    "**Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** model is a special case of RNNs, Recurrent Neural Networks. Basically, RNN works on sequential data: they accept multidimensional signals as input, and they produce a multidimensional output signal. Thanks to this configuration, each output is not just a function of the inputs in its own stage, but depends also on the output of the previous stages. It ensures that each input influences all the following outputs, or, on the other side, an output is a function of all the previous and current stages inputs. A simple illustration of RNNs is  shown in the figure below, wherer the inputs are in the bottom and the outputs in the top:\n",
    "![RNN](./graph/rnn/RNN.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main challenges to RNNS is the vanising/exploding gradient. Its means that with a long RNN, the training phase may lead to very tiny or huge gradients back-propagated throughout the network, which leads the weights to zero or infinity. LSTMs models is an evolution of RNNs to mitigate this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specificaly, the LSTM models have two outputs for each stage: one is the actual output of the model, and the other one, named memory, is the internal state of the stage. Both outputs are fed into the following stages, lowering the chances of having vanishing/exploding gradients. However, this comes with the price of higher model's complexity and larger memory footprint. It is strongly recommended to use GPU devices when training RNNS to speed up the running time. \n",
